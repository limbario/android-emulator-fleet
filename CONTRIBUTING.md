# How to contribute

Thank you for considering contribution to Android Emulator Fleet GitHub Action!

The process for contribution is quite simple; if you think a big change is
necessary, please open an issue first to discuss the change and invest into
implementation only after getting confirmation from the
[maintainers](./CODEOWNERS). If it's a fix for a small bug, feel free to open
the pull request right away with all the context that the maintainers may need
to understand why it's necessary.

## Testing

We have automated tests running for every pull request, so all those tests must
pass for a pull request to be considered at all.

We use GitHub Actions to test our GitHub Action! You can find all the tests in
[`.github`](.github).

## Submitting changes

Once you're ready with your change, go ahead and submit that pull request.
[Maintainers](./CODEOWNERS) should be notified but if you don't see any movement
for a day, feel free to ping them by mentioning in your pull request.
